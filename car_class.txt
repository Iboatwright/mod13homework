Chapter 14 Programming Exercise 2. Car Class
--------------------------------------------
Design a class named Car that has the following fields:
    ● yearModel: The yearModel field is an Integer that holds the car’s year
      model.
    ● make: The make field references a String that holds the make of the car.
    ● speed: The speed field is an Integer that holds the car’s current speed.

In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other
    methods:
    ● Constructor: The constructor should accept the car’s year model and make
      as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object’s yearModel
      and make fields. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed
      field.
    ● Accessors: Design appropriate accessor methods to get the values stored
      in an object’s yearModel, make, and speed fields.
    ● accelerate: The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each
      time it is called.
    ● brake: The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time
      it is called.

Next, design a program that creates a Car object, and then calls the
    accelerate method five times. After each call to the accelerate method,
    get the current speed of the car and display it. Then call the brake
    method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the current
    speed of the car and display it.


Module main()
    // Local variables for the car object's year_model and make
    Declare Integer in_year_model
    Declare String in_make

    // Call input module to have user set in_year_model and in_make.
    Call get_user_input(in_year_model, "year of the car's model")
    Call get_user_input(in_make, "make of the car")

    // A class variable to reference a Car object.
    Declare Car car_car

    // Created a new Car object
    Set car_car = New Car(in_year_model, in_make)

    // Call accelerate 5 times and print the speed after each call.
    For i = 1 To 5
        car_car.accelerate()
        Display car_car.speed


Class Car
    // The year_model field is an Integer that holds the car’s year model.
    Private Integer year_model

    // The make field references a String that holds the make of the car.
    Private String make

    // The speed field is an Integer that holds the car’s current speed.
    Private Integer speed

    // The constructor accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments.
    Public Module Car(Integer arg_year_model, String arg_make)
        // Set year_model, make and set speed to 0
        Set year_model = arg_year_model
        Set make = arg_make
        Set speed = 0
    End Module

    // Accessors to return class field values.
    Public Function Integer get_year_model()
        Return year_model
    End Function

    Public Function String get_make()
        Return make
    End Function

    Public Function Integer get_speed()
        Return speed
    End Function

    // accelerate adds 5 to the speed field.
    Public Method accelerate()
        Set speed = speed + 5
    End Method

    // brake subtracts 5 from the speed field.
    Public Method brake()
        If speed >= 5 Then
            Set speed = speed - 5
        End If
    End Method
End Class
